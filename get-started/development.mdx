<Info>**Prerequisite** Our SDK `@undrstnd/ai-engine` is still in beta.</Info>

## Setting up Your Development Environment

### Install Dependencies

To begin, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (v7 or higher) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1.22 or higher) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (v6 or higher) for package management
- [AI Engine SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@undrstnd/ai-engine) (v3.0.0 or higher) for AI models

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @undrstnd/ai-engine@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn upgrade @undrstnd/ai-engine
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm upgrade @undrstnd/ai-engine
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Configuration

<Tip>
  You get 3 EUR free credit when you sign up. You can use this credit to test
  our AI models.
</Tip>

Before making any API calls, you need an API key.

1. [Sign up](https://dev.undrstnd-labs.com/register) for an account.
2. Go to the [API key page](https://dev.undrstnd-labs.com/dashboard/api-keys) and create a new API key.
3. Copy the API key and save it in a secure location. Store the API key securely in your environment variables. Hereâ€™s an example for Node.js:

```bash .env.local
UNDRSTND_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

        const response = await
        fetch(`https://dev.undrstnd-labs.com/api/v1/chat/completions`, {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "x-api-key": "api_key_here",
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            stream: false,
            modelId: "mixtral-8x7b-32768",
            messages: [
              {
                name: "system",

    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
